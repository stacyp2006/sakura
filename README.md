# Sakura

## Project Description

Sakura is a 5 day solo development project completed during Module 3 of the Front-End Engineering Program at Turing School of Software and Design. For the purposes of this project, the user is a gardener who wants to plant a Japanese style garden. Project goals included demonstrating mastery with React, React Router and Asynchronous JavaScript.

## Install

- Clone down this repo
- Install dependencies via `npm install`
- Run `npm start`

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Router
- JavaScript
- Jest
- CSS/HTML
- Babel
- API used was [Trefle](https://trefle.io/)

## Accomplishments

- Testing: This is probably the most robust test suite I've written thus far in my development career. All my tests are currently passing. I have also successfully implemented PropTypes.

- React: As I continue to work with React, my understanding and ease of use improve. I was more thoughtful on this project, having learned lessons regarding design and accessibility on previous projects.

## Challenges

- Testing: I'm still working on improving my async testing. While these tests are passing, my `.catch` errors are logging in the terminal. I suspect I may not be mocking my returned data accurately.

- State: After using Redux on my last project, there were times that I wished I had used it on this project. While it is a small application that likely doesn't really need Redux, that indicates to me that I may still have some growth to do in architecting my components and/or managing state.

## Future Enhancements

- See the Issues tab on this repo for future changes to the application.
